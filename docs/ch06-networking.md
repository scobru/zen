# Chapter 6 — Networking

> **Goal:** Understand how ZEN peers synchronize, how to configure connections, and how the message protocol works.

---

## 6.1 Symmetric peers

There is no server-client distinction in ZEN. Every node is a **peer** — it can relay messages to other peers, persist data, and serve reads.

A "relay" is just a peer that happens to be publicly reachable and always online. You can run your own.

---

## 6.2 Connecting to peers

Pass peer URLs in the constructor:

```js
const zen = new ZEN({
  peers: ["wss://relay.example.com/zen"]
});
```

Or add peers at runtime:

```js
zen.opt("wss://relay.example.com/zen");

// Multiple peers
zen.opt(["wss://relay1.example.com/zen", "wss://relay2.example.com/zen"]);

// Object form
zen.opt({ peers: { "https://relay.example.com/zen": { url: "..." } } });
```

---

## 6.3 WebSocket transport

ZEN uses **WebSocket** as its primary transport. The implementation is internal — there is no `ws` npm dependency. The protocol is the same in Node.js and browser.

- Peer URL can be `ws://`, `wss://`, `http://`, or `https://` — ZEN normalizes them
- Each peer connection is managed independently; disconnects are retried automatically
- Messages are JSON strings (or batches of JSON strings)

---

## 6.4 The mesh layer (`src/mesh.js`)

`Mesh` handles message routing between peers. Key behaviors:

**Message size limit:**

```js
// Default: 30% of available memory, or ~90 MB
opt.max = opt.memory * 999 * 999 * 0.3 || 300000000 * 0.3;
```

Messages larger than `opt.max` bytes are rejected immediately with `{ dam: "!", err: "Message too big!" }`.

**Send batching:**

```js
opt.gap   = 0;   // delay before flushing outgoing messages (ms)
opt.pack  = opt.max * 0.0001;  // target pack size
opt.puff  = 9;   // messages processed per turn in batch loop
```

**Deduplication:** Every message has a `#` (message ID). The mesh tracks seen IDs via `dup` to prevent processing the same message twice, even when it arrives from multiple peers.

**`mesh.hear(raw, peer)`:** Called when a raw string arrives from a peer. Parses and routes it.

**`mesh.say(msg, peer)`:** Sends a message to a specific peer (or broadcasts if `peer` is omitted).

---

## 6.5 Message protocol

Every ZEN message is a JSON object with these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `#` | string | Message ID (9 random chars). Generated if absent. |
| `@` | string | Reply-to message ID. Present in ack messages. |
| `put` | object | Graph delta being written. Keys are souls, values are node objects. |
| `get` | object | Query. `{ "#": soul }` or `{ ".": lexical range }` |
| `opt` | object | Wire security options (`authenticator`, `pub`, `cert`) |
| `_` | function | Internal metadata carrier (not serialized). |
| `$` | Zen ref | Chain reference (not serialized). |

**Example put message:**

```json
{
  "#": "abc123xyz",
  "put": {
    "profile": {
      "_": { "#": "profile", ">": { "name": 1700000000000 } },
      "name": "Alice"
    }
  }
}
```

**Example get message:**

```json
{
  "#": "def456uvw",
  "get": { "#": "profile" }
}
```

---

## 6.6 Routing: `in` and `out`

Messages flow through two internal event channels:

- **`in`** — incoming from the wire. Security middleware, HAM, and storage run here.
- **`out`** — outgoing to the wire. After processing, messages are broadcast to peers.

The `universe()` router (in `src/root.js`) sits on both channels:

1. Incoming message arrives on `in`
2. `universe()` deduplicates, routes to `put()` or `get()` handler
3. Handler sets `msg.out = universe` and fires `at.on("out", msg)`
4. `universe()` on `out` calls `this.to.next(msg)` → propagates to mesh → sends to peers

---

## 6.7 Running a relay server

The simplest relay is just a ZEN instance with a WebSocket server. ZEN uses ES modules — use `import` syntax:

```js
import http from "http";
import ZEN from "@akaoio/zen";

const server = http.createServer().listen(8420);

const zen = new ZEN({
  web:  server,
  file: "relay-data",
});

console.log("Relay running on ws://localhost:8420/zen");
```

Clients connect with:

```js
const zen = new ZEN({ peers: ["ws://localhost:8420/zen"] });
```

For a production relay with SSL, logging, and auto-restart, use `script/server.js`:

```bash
node script/server.js
# or via npm
npm start          # node script/server.js
npm run start:prof # node --prof script/server.js (V8 profiling)
```

See `script/install.sh` for full production deployment (XDG paths, systemd service, SSL setup).

---

## 6.8 NTS — No Time Sync mode

ZEN supports a no-timestamp mode for environments without a reliable clock:

```js
const zen = new ZEN({ NTS: true });
```

When `msg.nts` or `msg.NTS` is set on a message, `universe()` skips the `out` broadcast. This prevents NTS messages from spreading to peers that do not understand the mode. The NTS logic is a temporary compatibility measure; a future version will remove this special case.

---

## 6.9 AXE — automatic peer clustering

`lib/axe.js` is the ZEN clustering engine. It runs **on both Node.js and in the browser**, but the two environments have completely different feature sets. The sections below document each separately.

AXE activates automatically when `lib/axe.js` is imported (the relay entry point `lib/server.js` does this). To disable it:

```js
// Option 1: constructor option (both environments)
const zen = new ZEN({ axe: false });

// Option 2: environment variable (Node.js only)
AXE=false node server.js
```

---

### 6.9.1 Node.js relay AXE

On a Node.js relay, AXE becomes the full routing and connection management layer.

**`axe.up` — upstream connection registry**

`root.axe.up` is a `pid → peer` map of all inbound connections known to this relay. AXE uses it as the authoritative view of which relay peers are alive:

```js
// internal structure (read-only from app code)
root.axe.up["<peer-pid>"] = peer;  // peer.url, peer.rtt, peer.wire
```

---

**PID-sort conflict resolution**

When two relay nodes both connect to each other (race condition on startup), AXE deterministically chooses which physical connection to drop. Both sides apply the same rule:

- Higher `opt.pid` side: drops its *outbound* connection (keeps the inbound from the remote)
- Lower `opt.pid` side: drops its *inbound* connection (keeps the outbound to the remote)

This guarantees exactly one connection survives without coordination messages.

---

**Auto-ping and RTT measurement**

AXE pings every outbound relay peer (those with a URL in `axe.up`) immediately on connect and every **30 s**:

```js
// Internal — you do not call this directly.
mesh.ping(peer);        // fires immediately on connection
setInterval(→ mesh.ping(peer), 30_000);
```

`peer.rtt` is populated by the ping/pong round-trip and used for RTT-sorted routing (see below).

---

**PEX acceptance (`dam:"opt"`)**

When a remote peer announces a new peer URL via the `dam:"opt"` message, AXE:
1. Normalises the protocol (`wss://` → `https://`)
2. Skips it if it matches `opt.domain` (self-connection guard)
3. Skips it if the URL is already an outbound peer
4. Skips if `axe.up` already has ≥ 99 entries
5. Otherwise calls `mesh.hi({ url })` to open a new outbound connection

```js
// AXE replies to the sender to confirm acceptance:
mesh.say({ dam: "opt", ok: 1, "@": msg["#"] }, peer);
```

---

**`axe.stay` — peer list persistence**

AXE automatically saves outbound peer URLs to `root.stats.stay.axe.up` (disk-persisted graph state) every **9 seconds** after any topology change. On restart, saved URLs are reconnected:

```js
// On startup, after 1 s, restore saved peers:
mesh.hear.opt({ opt: { peers: savedUrl } });   // re-uses normal PEX acceptance path
```

> Note: `axe.stay` is skipped when `opt.super = true` (boot-relay mode); BOOT handles reconnects there.

---

**RTT-sorted GET routing**

When a relay forwards a `get` request to other peers, it queries them in ascending RTT order — lowest-latency peer first. Peers with no RTT data sort to the end:

```
peers sorted: [rtt=12ms, rtt=45ms, rtt=∞(no data)]
```

If a peer replies with a matching hash (`msg["##"]` match), AXE stops querying the remaining peers. Relay peers (`axe.up`) are prioritised over leaf clients in broadcast.

---

**MOB — connection limit and redirection**

When inbound connection count exceeds `opt.mob`, AXE redirects the excess peer to another relay:

```js
// Configurable (default: 999999 — effectively unlimited):
const zen = new ZEN({ mob: 50 });
// Or via environment:
MOB=50 node server.js
```

The peer with the **highest RTT** among inbounds is chosen for redirection first. The redirected peer receives a `dam:"mob"` message with a list of relay URLs to connect to instead.

---

**WebRTC relay (`dam:"rtc"`)**

AXE routes `dam:"rtc"` messages directly to the target peer by `pid`, without broadcasting:

```js
// If the target pid is connected locally → unicast
// If not found → broadcast to relay peers (fall)
```

---

**Remote service management**

After a short delay, AXE loads `lib/service.js`, which registers a `dam:"service"` handler. This enables password-protected remote operations over the relay mesh (requires a running `systemd` service):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `update` | Runs `script/install.sh` to pull latest code and restart |

This is used internally by `zen update` CLI and the MCP `update` tool.

---

**Node.js AXE summary**

| Feature | Default | Config |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Inbound registry (`axe.up`) | always on | — |
| PID-sort conflict resolution | always on | — |
| Auto-ping every 30 s | always on | — |
| PEX acceptance (max 99 outbound) | always on | — |
| Self-connection guard | requires `opt.domain` | set via `install.sh` |
| `axe.stay` (peer persistence) | always on (non-boot mode) | `opt.super=true` disables |
| RTT-sorted GET routing | always on | — |
| MOB connection limit | 999999 (unlimited) | `opt.mob` / `MOB=` env |
| WebRTC relay routing | always on | — |
| Remote service (systemd) | loads if systemd present | — |
| Disable entire AXE | — | `{ axe: false }` or `AXE=false` |

---

### 6.9.2 Browser AXE

In the browser, AXE handles peer discovery and session continuity. There is no server-side routing — the browser is a leaf node, not a relay.

**Bootstrap sequence**

When a browser page loads, AXE attempts to find peers in this order:

| Step | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `localStorage["zenPeers"]` | Peers from previous sessions |
| 2 | Same-origin relay | `location.origin + "/zen"` |
| 3 | Localhost dev relay | `http://localhost:8420/zen` |
| 4 | `?peers=url1,url2` URL param | Comma-separated seed URLs |
| 5 | WebSocket domain scan | Probe sibling hostnames (see below) |
| 6 | `?axe=url` DHT fallback | Fetch URL for peer list — last resort if still not connected after 5 s |

---

**WebSocket domain scan**

The browser probes sibling relay domains using raw WebSocket connections (which bypass CORS). Given the current page hostname:

```
peer1.akao.io  →  probes peer0, peer2, … peer100
zen.akao.io    →  probes zen0, zen1, …
```

Up to **5 concurrent** WS probes; stops after **10** peers found or 100 candidates exhausted.

---

**PEX — receiving peer lists**

When connected to a relay, the browser receives `dam:"pex"` messages with a list of peer URLs and connects to them:

```js
mesh.hear["pex"] = function(msg) {
  msg.peers.forEach(addPeer);
};
```

On each new connection, AXE also fetches the relay's `/status` endpoint (signed JSON) and extracts additional peer URLs from `status.peers`.

---

**BroadcastChannel — cross-tab peer sharing**

AXE opens a `BroadcastChannel("zen")` to share discovered peer URLs across all tabs on the same origin. When one tab finds a relay, all tabs benefit immediately.

---

**Stable browser pid**

Each browser gets a random 9-char pid generated once and persisted to `localStorage["zenPid"]`. This is used by the relay for deduplication (PID-sort conflict resolution only applies to relay peers, not browsers).

---

**Fallback on disconnect**

When a relay disconnects, AXE picks a random known peer from its fallback list and reconnects to it (unless `navigator.onLine` is `false`, in which case it reduces retry count and waits for reconnection).

---

**Browser AXE summary**

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `localStorage` peer list | Restored on every page load |
| BroadcastChannel | Shares peers across same-origin tabs |
| WebSocket domain scan | Probes up to 100 sibling hostnames |
| PEX handler (`dam:"pex"`) | Receives peer arrays from relay |
| `/status` fetch on connect | Extracts peer list from signed relay status |
| Stable browser pid | Persisted in `localStorage["zenPid"]` |
| Fallback on disconnect | Reconnects to random known peer |
| Disable | `{ axe: false }` constructor option |

---

## 6.10 DAM relay — `zen.push()`

ZEN includes a lightweight **ephemeral messaging** layer built on top of the DAM (Directed Acyclic Mesh) protocol. Messages are XOR-routed hop-by-hop toward the target public key and **never written to the graph** — no CRDT, no persistence, no broadcast.

### `zen.push(targetPub, data, opt)`

Send an ephemeral message to any peer identified by its public key:

```js
// Sender
zen.push(pair.pub, "hello!");

// with options
zen.push(pair.pub, { type: "invite", room: "general" }, { ttl: 3 });
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `targetPub` | string | 45-char base62 compressed public key of the recipient |
| `data` | any | Payload (string, object, etc.) |
| `opt.ttl` | number | Max hops before the message is dropped (default: **5**) |

`push()` returns the chain instance so it is chainable:

```js
zen.push(pub, "ping").push(pub2, "also ping");
```

### Receiving pushed messages

Subscribe with `mesh.onRelay()` — returns an `off()` function to unsubscribe:

```js
const root = zen._;
const mesh = root.opt.mesh;

const off = mesh.onRelay(function(payload) {
  console.log("received:", payload);
});

// later
off();
```

### How routing works

When `zen.push(to, data)` is called, the mesh:

1. Checks if `to` is a directly connected peer — delivers immediately
2. Otherwise calls `mesh.route(to)` which selects the connected peer with the **smallest XOR distance** to `to` (greedy closest-hop)
3. Forwards with `ttl - 1`; the receiving peer repeats until the message arrives or TTL reaches 0
4. When the target peer receives a relay message addressed to its own pub key, `onRelay` subscribers are notified

```
A ──push(D)──► B  (B is XOR-closer to D)
               B ──relay──► C  (C is even closer)
                             C ──relay──► D  ✓
```

This is best-effort delivery — the sender does not receive a delivery confirmation. Use the graph (`zen.put`) when persistence or acknowledgement is required.

### DAM ping/pong and RTT

The mesh tracks round-trip time for each connected peer via `ping`/`pong` messages. AXE automatically pings each inbound peer on connect and every 30 s:

```js
// Internal — you do not call this directly. AXE handles it.
mesh.ping(peer);  // sends { dam: "ping", t: Date.now() }
// peer.rtt is updated on pong: exponential moving average (α = 0.5)
```

`peer.rtt` is used by AXE MOB pruning to evict the highest-latency peer first when the connection limit is reached.

---

## 6.11 WebRTC

`lib/webrtc.js` adds browser-to-browser WebRTC connections:

```js
import ZEN from "@akaoio/zen";
import "@akaoio/zen/lib/webrtc.js";

const zen = new ZEN({ rtc: { max: 5 } });
// max = maximum number of simultaneous WebRTC peers
```

WebRTC peers use `put(pid, cb, null, { acks: rtc.max })` internally to track connection state.

---

## 6.12 Multicast (LAN discovery)

`lib/multicast.js` provides UDP multicast for automatic peer discovery on a local network:

```js
import "@akaoio/zen/lib/multicast.js";
const zen = new ZEN({ multicast: true });
```

Useful for local-network deployments (IoT, offline-first apps).

---

## 6.13 Faith mode

The server entry point sets `root.opt.faith = true` automatically. In faith mode, ack messages (`msg["@"]` present, `msg.put` absent) are immediately rebroadcast to peers without re-processing. This reduces redundant computation on relay nodes.

```js
// server.js sets:
root.opt.faith = true;
root.opt.super = true;  // also set; marks this as a "super peer"
```

---

## 6.14 Self-discovery (`lib/discover.js`)

A relay peer needs to know its own domain or IP to announce itself to the network and to build correct self-URLs (`wss://peer1.akao.io:8420/zen`). `lib/discover.js` finds this offline-first:

| Priority | Method | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `~/.config/zen/domain` config file | Written by `install.sh` prompt or `ldom()` latch |
| 2 | `ip route get 8.8.8.8` | LAN/WAN interface IP, most reliable offline method |
| 3 | `hostname -I` | Fallback; first non-loopback IP |
| 4 | STUN (`stun.l.google.com:19302`) | Public IP behind NAT — RFC 5389 Binding Request |
| 5 | `api.ipify.org` / `ifconfig.me` | HTTP fallback only if all else fails |

```js
import { disc, DOMF } from "./lib/discover.js";

const { domain, ip, port, source } = await disc({ port: 8420 });
// source: "config" | "stun" | "http" | "ip" | "opt"
```

The domain is persisted to `DOMF` (`~/.config/zen/domain`) on first discovery so subsequent starts skip network calls. If the domain is still unknown at server start, `script/server.js` latches it from the first incoming HTTP request's `Host` header.

---

## 6.15 Smart domain scanning (`lib/scan.js`)

Given a known peer domain like `peer1.akao.io`, ZEN automatically scans for sibling peers by detecting the numeric index in the leftmost label and probing all candidates:

```
peer1.akao.io  →  peer{0..100}.akao.io
node-3.net     →  node-{0..100}.net
relay01.host   →  relay{00..100}.host   (zero-padded)
```

`lib/scan.js` is used by **both** the Node.js relay and the browser, but with different probe methods:

| Environment | Probe method | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Node.js relay | HTTP/HTTPS GET `/zen.js` | Full TCP connect; used by `script/server.js` |
| Browser | Raw WebSocket connect | WS bypasses CORS; used by AXE browser scan (§6.9.2) |

The scanner (`lib/scan.js`) exports:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `mkpat(domain)` | Parse domain → `{ prefix, index, tail, suffix, padLen }` |
| `bdom(pat, n)` | Build domain for index `n` from a parsed pattern |
| `candidateHosts(pat, opt)` | Return sorted array of candidate hostnames |
| `scan(domain, opt)` | Probe all candidates; returns `Promise<string[]>` of `wss://` URLs |
| `scanbg(domain, opt)` | Fire-and-forget variant; calls `opt.onFound(url)` per discovery |

**Bandwidth controls:**

- Stops probing once `opt.mfnd` peers found (default **10**) — avoids exhausting the full 0–100 range when the network is small
- Concurrent HTTP/HTTPS probes (default **10**), 3 s timeout each; tries HTTPS first, falls back to HTTP
- `script/server.js` tracks `spat` (scanned patterns) per cycle to skip re-probing the same pattern within one cycle
- Browser AXE uses up to **5** concurrent WS probes and stops after **10** found

**Backoff schedule (Node.js relay):**

```
Cycle 1: no new peers → next scan in 20 min
Cycle 2: no new peers → next scan in 40 min
...
Cap: 2 hours — minimum bandwidth regardless of network size
Discovery resets backoff to 10 min immediately.
```

---

## 6.16 Peer Exchange (PEX)

ZEN uses two complementary PEX mechanisms — one for relay-to-relay, one for relay-to-browser.

**Relay-to-browser (`dam:"pex"`)**

When a browser connects, the relay sends the full list of known relay peers as a `dam:"pex"` message:

```js
// Sent on "hi" (new browser connection):
mesh.say({ dam: "pex", peers: ["wss://peer0.akao.io:8420/zen", ...] }, newPeer);

// Browser-side handler (in lib/axe.js):
mesh.hear["pex"] = function(msg) {
  msg.peers.forEach(addPeer);
};
```

When a peer is discovered mid-session, it is **immediately broadcast** to all currently connected peers.

**Relay-to-relay (`dam:"opt"`)**

Relay nodes exchange peer URLs using the `dam:"opt"` message (part of the standard options sync message). AXE on the receiving relay decides whether to open a new outbound connection (see §6.9.1 — PEX acceptance).

```js
// Relay announces itself to a newly-connected relay:
mesh.say({ dam: "opt", opt: { peers: "wss://zen.akao.io:8420/zen" } }, peer);

// Receiving relay's AXE handler:
mesh.hear["opt"] = function(msg, peer) {
  // validates, deduplicates, calls mesh.hi(url) if accepted
};
```

**Full-mesh prevention:**

ZEN uses two complementary mechanisms to prevent every peer connecting to every other peer (O(n²) links):

| Layer | Mechanism | Where |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Inbound | **MOB** — redirects excess inbound connections to other peers | §6.9.1 |
| Outbound | **`MUPS = 10`** — scan-initiated `mesh.hi()` capped at 10 upstream connections | `script/server.js` `adp()` |
| Outbound (AXE) | **max 99** relay-to-relay connections via `dam:"opt"` PEX | `lib/axe.js` `mesh.hear["opt"]` |

`root.axe.up` (AXE upstream connection map) is the source of truth for relay connectivity. Broadcast (`pex` send) is always allowed regardless of upstream limit — only the actual WebSocket connection is capped.

---

## 6.17 UDP fast path

The relay optionally upgrades peer-to-peer data transfer to **UDP** for lower latency. WebSocket remains the control plane (authentication, peer discovery, handshake). UDP is a data plane shortcut — if it fails, messages fall back to WebSocket silently.

### How it works

On startup the relay creates two UDP sockets:

```js
const udpSock4 = dgram.createSocket({ type: 'udp4', reuseAddr: true });
const udpSock6 = dgram.createSocket({ type: 'udp6', reuseAddr: true, ipv6Only: true });
```

Both bind to `UDP_PORT` (default **8421**). `ipv6Only: true` ensures `udpSock6` only receives native IPv6 packets, avoiding port conflicts with `udpSock4`.

### Handshake

When peer A connects to peer B over WebSocket, each side sends a `dam: "?"` message containing its UDP port and a random 32-char hex token:

```json
{ "dam": "?", "udpPort": 8421, "udpToken": "<32 hex chars>" }
```

Once both sides have exchanged tokens, `setupUdpForPeer` creates a `peer.udpSay(fwd)` closure:

```
peer.wire._socket.remoteAddress  →  socket selection
  ::ffff:x.x.x.x                →  strip to IPv4, use udpSock4
  native IPv6 (contains ":")     →  use udpSock6 (if available)
  hostname / plain IPv4          →  use udpSock4
```

### Packet format

Every UDP packet is prefixed with the **recipient's** token:

```
<32-hex-token>|<JSON message>
```

The receiver validates the token prefix before passing the message to `pmsh.hear()`. Packets from unknown sources or with incorrect tokens are silently dropped.

### Security

- Token is a per-session secret exchanged over TLS-protected WebSocket
- Each peer gets the _other_ peer's token (the token the other side expects)
- Replay protection comes from the mesh deduplication layer (`msg.#`)

### Address family selection

WS connections may use IPv6 (RFC 6724 prefers it when both sides have AAAA records). `setupUdpForPeer` selects the matching UDP socket to avoid protocol mismatch:

| WS `remoteAddress` | UDP socket | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------|-------|
| `::ffff:1.2.3.4` | udpSock4 | IPv4-mapped — strip prefix |
| `2001:db8::1` | udpSock6 | Native IPv6 |
| hostname / `1.2.3.4` | udpSock4 | Hostname or plain IPv4 |

If `udpSock6` creation fails (platform does not support `ipv6Only`), it is set to `null` and all peers fall back to udpSock4 via hostname DNS lookup — no crash, no message loss.

### Relay flood integration

When `peer.udpSay` is set, the relay's flood loop calls it instead of `peer.wire.send()`:

```js
if (peer.udpSay) peer.udpSay(fwd);
else if (peer.wire) peer.wire.send(fwd);
```

If the UDP send fails, the error is logged but no automatic WS fallback occurs — the message is considered delivered (deduplication prevents re-sending on the next WS message from that peer).

### Port

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `UDP_PORT` | `8421` | UDP listen port (relay) |

The relay binds WebSocket on **8420** and UDP on **8421** by default.

---

## 6.18 `root.graph` GC — in-memory cache eviction

`root.graph` is an in-memory cache of every graph node the relay has ever processed. It grows without bound, creating an OOM risk on long-running relay nodes.

Since all data is persisted to disk (RAD), evicting a soul from the in-memory cache only causes a cache miss on the next access — the data is safely read back from storage.

### How it works

The relay tracks the last write time for each soul via a `root.on('put', fn)` middleware hook, then periodically evicts souls from `root.graph` when heap usage exceeds a threshold:

```js
// Middleware: track write time for each soul
root.on('put', function graphGcTrack(msg) {
  const soul = msg.put?.['#'];
  if (soul) graphAt.set(soul, Date.now());
  this.to.next(msg);  // required to continue the middleware chain
});

// Periodic eviction
setInterval(() => {
  const heapMB = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed / 1048576;
  if (heapMB < GRAPH_GC_HEAP_MB) return;

  for (const soul of Object.keys(root.graph)) {
    if (root.next[soul]) continue;          // active on() listener — skip
    if (graphAt.get(soul) > cutoff) continue; // written recently — skip
    delete root.graph[soul];
    graphAt.delete(soul);
  }
}, GRAPH_GC_INTERVAL).unref();
```

Two guards prevent evicting important souls:
- `root.next[soul]` — soul has an active `on()` listener; evicting would break live subscriptions
- `graphAt.get(soul) > cutoff` — soul was written recently (default 120 s); gives new data time to propagate to peers before falling off cache

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `GRAPH_GC_MB` | `400` | Heap (MB) that triggers eviction |
| `GRAPH_GC_SEC` | `60` | GC interval in seconds |
| `GRAPH_GC_KEEP` | `120` | Keep souls written in the last N seconds |
